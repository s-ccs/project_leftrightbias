	abstract = {To investigate whether fixation durations are adjusted to the duration of a foveal analysis task, we designed a search task in which each stimulus element yielded information about the position of the target. We asked subjects to look for the target by making eye movements in the direction indicated by each stimulus element. We explicitly asked the subjects to make the eye movements in the correct direction, but they did not always do this. They made only 65–80\% of the eye movements in directions indicated by the stimulus elements. From these results we conclude that fixation durations are not solely determined by the immediate visual stimulus and that subjects encounter difficulties when trying to increase fixation durations to values that would enable them to direct saccades accurately. In a second experiment we shortened the presentation time in order to provide an incentive for the subjects to speed up search. Shortening the presentation time did not affect fixation duration. Therefore, we suggest that fixation duration is controlled by a mechanism that uses estimations of the foveal analysis time of previous fixated stimulus elements.},

Saccades in fractals were more likely to be horizontal, regardless of orientation. In scenes, the ﬁrst saccade often moved down and subsequent eye movements were predominantly vertical, relative to the scene. These biases were modulated by the distribution of visual features (saliency and clutter) in the scene.

	abstract = {Background and objectives
Attentional biases play an important role in the development and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}). Previous studies using reaction time tasks in {OCD} have produced inconsistent results. This is the first study to measure attentional biases in patients with several subtypes of {OCD} using eye tracking.
Methods
Twenty-eight patients with {OCD} and 21 healthy controls were assessed using a free-viewing paradigm, incorporating contamination-related, checking-related, and neutral stimuli. Attentional patterns were measured using an eye tracker. A possible vigilance bias was assessed using entry time, and a possible maintenance bias was assessed using dwell time.
Results
Patients with checking-related symptoms of {OCD} showed a maintenance bias but no vigilance bias in regard to checking-related compared to neutral stimuli. No differences in attention were found in patients with contamination-related symptoms.
Limitations
Internal validity is restricted due to a high overlap between subgroups, the lack of negative (not {OCD}-related) control stimuli, and the absence of a clinical control group.
Conclusions
Patients with checking-related symptoms of {OCD} showed a maintenance bias to checking-related stimuli. Due to methodological limitations, the results should be considered preliminary and need to be replicated before firm conclusions can be drawn.},

In the chimeric faces task, subjects were required to judge which of a pair of faces appeared happier. Stimuli comprising each pair were mirror images, with the smiling half on the left of one face and on the right of the other. In the grey scales task, subjects were required to indicate which of two shaded rectangles appeared to be darker overall. Again, stimuli were mirror images, with the darker end appearing either on the left or on the right. Patients exhibited a significant rightward bias on both experimental tasks, in contrast to the significant leftward bias exhibited by controls. There was no significant correlation between patients' performances on standard clinical tests and the extent of bias on the two experimental tasks, suggesting that such patients exhibit distinct impairments of spatial cognition which are differentially indexed by the two types of task. Moreover, for both patients and controls, scores obtained on the two perceptual bias tasks were unrelated, suggesting that they may engage stimulus-specific processes which have different underlying patterns of asymmetrical processing. These data provide further support for models which propose that the heterogeneity of disorders of spatial cognition arise from disruption of distinct neural mechanisms.},

            In this Methods Showcase Article, we outline a workflow for running behavioral experiments online, with a focus on experiments that rely on presentation of complex stimuli and measurement of reaction times, which includes many psycholinguistic experiments. The workflow that we describe here relies on three tools: {OpenSesame}/{OSWeb} (open source) provides a user‐friendly graphical interface for developing experiments; {JATOS} (open source) is server software for hosting experiments; and Prolific (commercial) is a platform for recruiting participants. These three tools integrate well with each other and together provide a workflow that requires little technical expertise. We discuss, and illustrate through an example study, several challenges that are associated with running online experiments, including temporal precision, the implementation of counterbalancing, data quality, and issues related to privacy and ethics. We conclude that these challenges are real but surmountable, and that in many cases online experiments are a viable alternative to laboratory‐based experiments.},

Design/methodology/approach: Using an eye-tracking approach combined with traditional verbal measures, we compared attention and memory measures from a sample composed of bidirectional (Arab/English) readers and unidirectional readers. Findings: The findings reveal that unidirectional and bidirectional readers differ in attention patterns. Compared to bidirectional readers, unidirectional readers pay less attention to the logo on the bottom right corner of the webpage based on verbal measures. The eye-tracking data of the two groups further identify differences based on total hits and duration time. Unidirectional left-to-right readers demonstrate higher fluency in feature-based attention whereas bidirectional readers show higher fluency in spatial attention. Research limitations: Individuals from the sampled cultures would have a considerably different mindset regarding exposure to pictorial materials in general. Future research that replicates or extends the current study needs to ensure comparability via both cultural-psychological and demographic analyses. Practical implications: The findings suggest that directional reading bias should be taken into consideration in web design, online advertising and search patterns in an international marketing context.},

In Experiment 2, participants were instructed to avoid looking at the emotional pictures, but these were still more likely to be fixated first and gazed longer during the first-pass viewing than neutral pictures.

It is not known, however, whether the global salience of a stimulus, that is, its effectiveness in the competition for attention with other stimuli, is a function of the local salience or an independent measure. Further, do task and familiarity with the competing images influence eye movements? Here, we investigated the direction of the first saccade to characterize and analyze the global visual salience of competing stimuli. Participants freely observed pairs of images while eye movements were recorded. The pairs balanced the combinations of new and already seen images, as well as task and task-free trials. Then, we trained a logistic regression model that accurately predicted the location—left or right image—of the first fixation for each stimulus pair, accounting too for the influence of task, familiarity, and lateral bias. The coefficients of the model provided a reliable measure of global salience, which we contrasted with two distinct local salience models, {GBVS} and Deep Gaze. The lack of correlation of the behavioral data with the former and the small correlation with the latter indicate that global salience cannot be explained by the feature-driven local salience of images. Further, the influence of task and familiarity was rather small, and we reproduced the previously reported left-sided bias. Summarized, we showed that natural stimuli have an intrinsic global salience related to the human initial gaze direction, independent of the local salience and little influenced by task and familiarity.},

While patients with hemispatial neglect mistakenly bisect horizontal lines to the right of centre, neurologically healthy individuals show a mean leftward error. Here, two experiments demonstrated a robust tendency for participants to saccade to the left when viewing photographs. We were able to manipulate this bias by using an asymmetrical gaze-contingent window, which revealed more of the scene on one side of fixation-causing participants to saccade more often in that direction. A second experiment demonstrated the same change in eye movements occurring rapidly from trial to trial, and investigated whether it would carry over and effect attention during a line bisection task. There was some carry-over from gaze-contingent scene viewing to the eye movements during line bisection. However, despite frequent initial eye movements and many errors to the left, manual responses were not affected by this change in orienting. We conclude that the mechanisms underlying asymmetrical attention in picture scanning and line bisection are flexible and can be separated, with saccades in scene perception driven more by a skewed perceptual span.},

This limitation is fundamental to human brain function: Individual capacity is highly correlated with intelligence measures and capacity is reduced in neuropsychiatric diseases. Although human capacity limitations are well studied, their mechanisms have not been investigated at the single-neuron level. Simultaneous recordings from monkey parietal and frontal cortex revealed that visual capacity limitations occurred immedi- ately upon stimulus encoding and in a bottom-up manner. Capacity limitations were found to reflect a dual model of working memory. The left and right halves of visual space had independent capacities and thus are discrete resources. However, within each hemifield, neural information about successfully remembered objects was re- ducedbyaddingfurtherobjects, indicatingthat resources are shared. Together, these results suggest visual capacity limitation is due to discrete, slot-like, resources, each containing limited pools of neural information that can be divided among objects.},

	abstract = {An exhaustive qualitative (vote-counting) review is conducted of the literature concerning visual and non-visual line bisection in neurologically normal subject populations. Although most of these studies report a leftward bisection error (i.e., pseudoneglect), considerable between-study variability and inconsistency characterize this literature. A meta-analysis of this same literature is performed in which the total quantitative data set, comprising 73 studies (or sub-studies) and 2191 subjects, is analyzed with respect to 26 performance factors. The meta-analytic results indicate a significant leftward bisection error in neurologically normal subjects, with an overall effect size of between -0.37 and -0.44 (depending on integration method), which is significantly modulated to varying degrees by a number of additional task or subject variables. For example, visual bisection tasks, midsagittal-pointing tasks and tactile bisection tasks all lead to leftward errors, while kinesthetic tasks result in rightward errors. Tachistoscopic forced-choice testing methods reveal much greater estimates of bisection error (effect size = -1.32) than do manual method-of-adjustment procedures (effect size= -0.40). Subject age significantly modulates line bisection performance such that older subjects err significantly rightward compared to younger subjects, and to veridical line midpoint. Male subjects make slightly larger leftward errors than do female subjects. Handedness has a small effect on bisection errors, with dextrals erring slightly further to the left than sinistral subjects. The hand used to perform manual bisection tasks modulated performance, where use of the left hand lead to greater leftward errors than those obtained using the right hand. One of the most significant factors modulating bisection error is the direction in which subjects initiate motor scanning (with either eye or hand), where a left-to-right scan pattern leads to large leftward errors while a right-to-left scan pattern leads to rightward errors.},

	abstract = {Viewing behavior exhibits temporal and spatial structure that is independent of stimulus content and task goals. One example of such structure is horizontal biases, which are likely rooted in left-right asymmetries of the visual and attentional systems. Here, we studied the existence, extent, and mechanisms of this bias. Left- and right-handed subjects explored scenes from different image categories, presented in original and mirrored versions. We also varied the spatial spectral content of the images and the timing of stimulus onset. We found a marked leftward bias at the start of exploration that was independent of image category. This left bias was followed by a weak bias to the right that persisted for several seconds. This asymmetry was found in the majority of right-handers but not in left-handers. Neither low- nor high-pass filtering of the stimuli influenced the bias. This argues against mechanisms related to the hemispheric segregation of global versus local visual processing. Introducing a delay in stimulus onset after offset of a central fixation spot also had no influence. The bias was present even when stimuli were presented continuously and without any requirement to fixate, associated to both fixation- and saccade-contingent image changes. This suggests the bias is not caused by structural asymmetries in fixation control. Instead the pervasive horizontal bias is compatible with known asymmetries of higher-level attentional areas related to the detection of novel events.},

	abstract = {When observers view an image, their initial eye movements are not equally distributed but instead are often biased to the left of the picture. This pattern has been linked to pseudoneglect, the spatial bias to the left that is observed in line bisection and a range of other perceptual and attentional tasks. Pseudoneglect is often explained according to the dominance of the right-hemisphere in the neural control of attention, a view bolstered by diﬀerences between left- and right-handed participants in both line bisection and eye movements. We re-examined this observation in eighty participants (half of whom reported being left handed) who completed a computerised line bisection task and viewed a series of images. We failed to replicate the previously-reported eﬀect of handedness on eye movements in image viewing, with both groups showing a large average bias to the left on the ﬁrst saccade. While there was a modest eﬀect of handedness on line bisection, there was no correlation between the two tasks. Stable individual diﬀerences, as well as a shorter latency on the initial saccade, were robust predictors of an initial saccade to the left. Therefore, while there seems to be a reﬂexive and idiosyncratic drive to look to the left, it is not well accounted for by handedness and may have diﬀerent mechanisms from other forms of pseudoneglect.},

When looking at pictures of natural scenes, neurologically intact individuals show a leftward bias in the direction of their first eye movement. The present study investigates the time course of this pseudoneglect and how it depends on task-related control. Eye movements were recorded from 72 participants, each viewing 135 scenes under three different viewing instructions (memorization, esthetic preference judgment, object-in-scene search). In the memorization and preference tasks, pseudoneglect had a maximum extent of about 1° and lasted for about 1500msec, or 5 fixations. The effect was somewhat reduced in the preference task, which gave subjects free reign to fixate anywhere they wanted to. During scene search, a task that is guided primarily by top-down control, observers also showed a distinct pseudoneglect. Strikingly, a leftward bias was present even when the search object was located in the right hemispace. Search performance was not affected by the observed spatial asymmetries. The effects likely arise from a right-hemisphere dominance for visuo-spatial attention. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Translation and competition among internal representations in a reverse Stroop effect. Perception \&Psychophysics, 65, 367–378.] for this task. When the spatial probabilities of the search target were manipulated either in accord with or in opposition to the existing upper-left bias, two orthogonal factors of interference in the latency data were differentially affected. The two factors corresponded to two different forms of representation and search. Target probabilities consistent with the gaze bias encouraged opportunistic serial search (including gaze shifts), while symmetrically opposing target probabilities produced latency patterns more consistent with parallel search based on a sensory code.},

	abstract = {Understanding how early scene viewing is guided can reveal fundamental brain mechanisms for quickly making sense of our surroundings. Viewing is often initiated from the left side. Across two experiments, we focused on search initiation for lateralised targets within real-world scenes, investigating the role of the cerebral hemispheres in guiding the first saccade. We aimed to disentangle hemispheric contribution from the effects of reading habits and distinguish between an overall dominance of the right hemisphere for visuospatial processing and finer hemispheric specialisation for the type of target template representation (from pictorial versus verbal cues), spatial scale (global versus local), and timescale (short versus longer). We replicated the tendency to initiate search leftward in both experiments. However, we found no evidence supporting a significant impact of left-to-right reading habits, either as a purely motor or attentional bias to the left. A general visuospatial dominance of the right hemisphere could not account for the results either. In Experiment 1, we found a greater probability of directing the first saccade toward targets in the left visual field but only after a verbal target cue, with no lateral differences after a pictorial cue. This suggested a contribution of the right hemisphere specialisation in perceptually simulating words' referents. Lengthening the Inter-Stimulus Interval between the cue and the scene (from 100 to 900 ms) resulted in reduced first saccade gain in the left visual field, suggesting a decreased ability of the the right hemisphere to use the target template to guide gaze close to the target object, which primarily depends on local information processing. Experiment 2, using visual versus auditory verbal cues, replicated and extended the findings for both first saccade direction and gain. Overall, our study shows that the multidetermined functional specialisation of the cerebral hemispheres is a key driver of early scene search and must be incorporated into theories and models to advance understanding of the mechanisms that guide viewing behaviour.},
